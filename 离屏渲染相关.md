We are asking Core Animation to generate the shadow
```
CALayer *imageViewLayer = cell.imageView.layer;
imageViewLayer.shadowColor = [UIColor blackColor].CGColor;
imageViewLayer.shadowOpacity = 1.0;
imageViewLayer.shadowRadius = 2.0;
imageViewLayer.shadowOffset = CGSizeMake(1.0, 1.0);
```
Perhaps there is a more efficient way
```
imageViewLayer.shadowPath = CGPathCreateWithRect(imageRect, NULL);
```
